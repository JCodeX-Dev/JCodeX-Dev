👋 Hi there! Welcome to my Github profile.

I'm Jeremy, a Cloud DevOps Engineer with a passion for Web Development (Spring Boot/Nodejs) and kuberenetes technologies. I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow as a developer.

👀 In my Github repositories, you'll find a mix of personal projects and contributions to open-source projects. I enjoy working on projects that solve real-world problems and push the boundaries of what's possible with technology.

Some of my areas of expertise include Java, Spring Boot, Docker, K8s, Jenkins, and I'm always striving to improve my skills in areas such as working with frontend technolgies.

I believe in the power of collaboration and community, so feel free to reach out if you're interested in working together on a project or just want to chat about coding and technology. 📫

Also, if you're interested in supporting my work 💞️, click on the "Sponsor" button on my profile and see how you can contribute. Your support means the world to me and helps me continue to do what I love.
